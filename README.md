# MyPythonTasks

This repository contains hands-on Python learning tasks created to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts beyond the ALX curriculum.

Each script focuses on a specific concept such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Error Handling
- Unit Testing
- File I/O
- CLI Interactions

### ðŸ“‚ Current Tasks

- `student_report_card.py`  
  A simple CLI app that allows users to add student grades and calculate their average using classes and methods.

### ðŸš€ Purpose

This repo serves as my **personal learning playground** â€” to explore, make mistakes, and grow as a Python developer.
